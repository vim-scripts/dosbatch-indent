I couldn't find an indent script for DOS batch files so I wrote a simple one.  It just follows these rules:
 - generally keep the indent of the previous line 
 - if previous line is not a comment and has ( and no matching ), increase indent
 - if this line starts with ), decrease indent

I started by cutting down and modifying Erik Janssen's awk.vim.
